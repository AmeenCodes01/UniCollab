## Overview

Unicollab is a platform I built to help students collaborate on projects, gain experience, and connect across disciplines. As a first-year Maths and Computer Science student, I noticed that while many of us were working on personal skills or projects, it was difficult to find teammates with complementary skills.

Unicollab solves this by allowing students to:

* Post project ideas.
* Specify what skills they are looking for in collaborators.
* Join projects regardless of skill level, making it inclusive for both beginners and experienced students.

The platform encourages learning by doing, teamwork, and building stronger projects by combining skills from different fields.

For example:

* A website project could benefit from a designer or artist.
* A mental health app could be improved by working with psychology students.
* Projects can be anything from a simple game clone to an AI-driven app.

## Background

I originally began building Unicollab while in talks with professors and my department. The idea was to launch a real-world solution for students across the university.

Although the collaboration could not continue (and the project was paused before final polish), I implemented most of the functionality and deployed a working MVP. Professors acknowledged the value of the idea, but I decided to stop development when the support on the university side faded.

## Current State

* **Implemented**:

  * Core functionality (posting, joining, saving projects).
  * Authentication and backend integration.
  * User flows for idea sharing and collaboration.

* **Pending/Incomplete**:

  * UI polish and refinement.
  * Minor improvements to UX and layout.

## Why This Project Matters

* Builds **team-based experience** for students.
* Helps students add **real collaborative work** to their portfolios.
* Encourages cross-disciplinary projects where creativity and technical skills combine.

## Demo

A basic MVP has been deployed to demonstrate the core functionality.
